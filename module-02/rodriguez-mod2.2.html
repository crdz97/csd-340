        <h2> About me</h2>
        <p class="intro"> I'm Carolina, Carol or Caro for short. In my opinion, it can be a tongue twister if you try to say it in Spanish. My primary language is Spanish, 
            but I'd like to think I have gotten better at reading, writing and speaking English over the years. If anyone is interested in learning Spanish, 
            I'd be happy to teach you haha! I am located in Texas, if you would like to guess what part of Texas, it was once known as the “Wild West boomtown”. </p>

        <p> <span class="sentence">The part of Texas I'm from has a really laid-back vibe with a strong mix of Latin and Southwestern culture.</span> The city is known for great food, especially tacos 
            and Latin cuisine, and for having beautiful desert and mountain views. Being close to the boarder does bring a more authentic flavor to the food. It is also known
            for having amazing sunsets almost every night.</p>
            
        <p>A few of my favorite things include taking my husky on walks, watching movies, playing video games, cooking and baking. I can make a mean cheesecake, maybe I will get to share my recipe here.
            Fun fact, I have a degree in baking!</p>
            
        <p> My short-term goals are to finish this course with a good grade, create a better schedule for myself to learn and learn as much as I can about web development. 
            My long-term goals are to become a front-end developer, lose weight, finish school and work on creating beautiful and user-friendly websites for my local community! 
            I am very hopeful and motivated to make this happen.</p>
